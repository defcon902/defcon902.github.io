We are a inclusive group and welcome everybody no matter the background or skillset, if you are a n00b or 1337, you have a place here. Jeff Hann (@obihann on Twitter, or VE1OBI on amateur radio) is the official leader pending any coups or mutinies.

## Show and Tell
Were all about learning, experimenting, and exploring here, and we encourage both discussion and showing off new ideas or technology. We have also amassed a small armoury of security related gear suck as lock picks, SDR's, proximarks, and similar, if you are interested in these check out the [list])(https://github.com/defcon902/defcon902.github.io/blob/master/show-and-tell.md) of what we have and reach out if you want to see something.
