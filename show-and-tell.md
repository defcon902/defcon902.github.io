# Show and Tell

A big part of DC902 is "show and tell", and this is not only cool projects your working on but fun toys too. In the spirit of this we keep a list of the devices our members have and are willing to demo at a meeting.
If you see anything that excites, scares, or intrigues you please reach out to the owner of the device and ask them to bring it to the next meeting.
